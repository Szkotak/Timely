# Timely

Timely is a time management tool to help you visualize how you are spending your time vs. how you want to spend your time.
The user can input specific activites they want to track as well as the time currently spent and goal times. This will help the user visualize their time and track progress. 

We used materialize.css for the framework and chart.js for the graphs.
